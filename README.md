Solutions  for 10-Day Recursion Roadmap Challenge by Parikh Jain

## Overview

The Recursion Roadmap Challenge is designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of recursion and its applications in solving various coding problems. Each day, a new problem will be presented, and you will be encouraged to solve it using recursion. The problems are carefully selected to cover a wide range of scenarios and difficulties, ensuring that you develop a strong foundation in recursive algorithms.

## Solutions

Inside each day's directory, you will find a solution file named question_name.java. This file contains a possible solution to the corresponding problem using recursion. You can refer to these solutions to understand how the problem can be solved recursively. However, keep in mind that the challenge is designed for your own practice, and contribution of solutions is not allowed in this repository.

Feel free to experiment with the solutions and modify them to improve your understanding of recursion. You can test the solutions by running them using a Java compiler or your preferred programming environment.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are not allowed as the challenge is intended for personal practice. However, if you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to open an issue in the repository. We appreciate your feedback and will address any concerns as soon as possible.
